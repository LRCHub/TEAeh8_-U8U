Hey baby, I'm ready to take the field
I hope you got your game face on
We about to make history

Hey baby welcome to my home
Tonight It's you and me we all alone
And you know exactly just what I'm on
Don't need no clothes
Leave them heels on

Tonight I'm gonna break a world record
I see the signs baby I'm not striking out
And can't nobody read your body better
I'ma show you exactly what I'm about
