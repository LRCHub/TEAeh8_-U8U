We were raised in a bad neighbourhood
Yes, we were
I got stabbed and love
Didn't look so good, no
Sister Johnson lived two blocks away
Did I tell ya?
Gave me some advice the other day
What did she say?
She said: "Sam"
You're just like a ball
You gotta break it hard
Protect it from harm
You got to make the rest-up
When you hit the ball

Knock it out of the park, mmmmm
Cause a single will put you
In the dark now
When you swing, swing, swing
For the pitcher, Lord
Hitting in a double play
Just don't make no sense
Love her like a baseball
I been told tell 'em son
You don't win by getting on the base
Honey, you got to make the score good God
You might put another man up
But you got to go to bat, yeah
Don't you try to swing for a single
She won't go for that
Hey, hey
Make sure you don't be fakin'
When you say you gonna quit her
Yeah, yeah
You might know your very next friend
Might be her pinch hitter
Yeah, yeah, oh, Lord
Might be her pinch hitter
Baby, yeah
Darling your kisses
Have got to have a spark
And when you do your lovin' baby

You got to knock it out of the park
Look, when you swing, swing
Swing for the pitcher
Putting in a double play y'all
Just don't make no sense good God
Hit it, knock it out of the park
Hit it, knock it out of the park
Love her like a baseball
My, my, my, my baby
Hit it, got to knock it out of the park
My, my, my baby
You got to play to win y'all
Hit the ball
Got to make the score yeah
Hit it, knock it out of the park
Get a hold on
Knock it out of the park
Hit...
